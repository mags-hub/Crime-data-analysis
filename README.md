his project explores the patterns, trends, and distribution of reported crimes in South Africa over an 11-year period (2005â€“2016). Using an open-source dataset from Kaggle and powerful Python libraries, the analysis aims to uncover which crime categories are most prevalent, how crime rates evolve over time, and how these trends differ across provinces and police stations.

The goal of the project is to develop practical skills in data wrangling, visualization, and insight generation using real-world data, and to create a valuable exploratory analysis that could inform decision-making or future research.
